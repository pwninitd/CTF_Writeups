# CTF_Writeups

Welcome to the **CTF_Writeups** repository! This is where I will be posting all my writeups from the Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions I have participated in. Each writeup will provide detailed explanations of the challenges, the steps I took to solve them, and the lessons learned along the way.

## What is a CTF?

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity contests where participants solve challenges to demonstrate their hacking skills. These challenges can range from exploiting vulnerabilities and solving puzzles to reverse engineering and cryptography.

## Purpose of This Repository

The main goal of this repository is to share my experiences and solutions from various CTF competitions. By documenting these writeups, I hope to provide valuable insights and learning resources for others interested in the field of cybersecurity. 

## Structure of Writeups

Each writeup will be organized as follows:
1. **Challenge Overview**: A brief description of the challenge.
2. **Reconnaissance**: Steps taken to gather information and understand the challenge.
3. **Exploitation**: Detailed explanation of the methods and techniques used to solve the challenge.
4. **Conclusion**: Summary of what was learned from the challenge and any key takeaways.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Read**: Browse through the writeups to learn about different CTF challenges and solutions.
- **Learn**: Understand the methodologies and tools used in solving various cybersecurity problems.
- **Contribute**: Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements or sharing your own solutions to the challenges.
