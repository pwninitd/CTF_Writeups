## My Experience at corCTF

corCTF2024 was an exciting and intense Capture The Flag competition that tested my skills and knowledge in the web category. The event was well-organized, and the challenges were thoughtfully crafted to push participants to think critically and creatively.

## Reflection and Future Goals

While I managed to solve two out of the six challenges, I believe there's always room for improvement. I aim to enhance my skills and perform better in future CTF competitions. Each challenge provided valuable insights and learning opportunities that I can apply to my future endeavors.
